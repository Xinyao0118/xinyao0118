# Welcome to Xinyao's Github 😊

Hi, I'm Xinyao, a proactive Gemini with the ISFP personality type. I'm intensely curious about fresh and challenging endeavors. I love keeping up with the latest technological advancements, and I pride myself on my strong ability to act upon and replicate them. My planning preference leans towards setting short-term goals for the next three days and long-term visions spanning five years. I cherish the dynamic nature of plans as they progress and am passionate about harnessing my creativity to guide new directions in planning.

Lately, I've been engrossed in Kaggle competitions. I've participated in three projects so far: ICR, LLM, and CAFA. Concurrently, I'm diving deep into advanced solutions from past projects and honing my predictive techniques. Two of them are Ubiquant prediction and AI Games.

In 2020, I graduated from Columbia University with a Master's in Biostatistics. Pinned on my homepage are the projects I undertook during my MS, many of which relate to healthcare. My primary focus at Columbia was on theory and decision-making, encompassing fundamental knowledge in computational statistics like data mining, optimization, and more. My thesis centered on causal inference, an intriguing direction in statistics that extends well into the realm of Machine Learning.

I'll keep updating my GitHub with new projects. Stay tuned!

# Fun Fact
### Welcome our fluffy friend --> 🐱 Severus  🐱

<img src="resources/Severus.jpg"  height="300">

Severus is my speakless friend, he is a 2 years old male ragdoll. He loves running around the house after pooping.

### My another friend --> 🎻 Violin 🎻
I was a second violinist in Columbia University Irving Medical Center Symphony Orchestra.

Once a rehearsal we switched the conductor, the old one became my partner and sat next to me.

Then he finally knew I was the one who played out of tune.
